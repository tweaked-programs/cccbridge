About
-----
With this Mod it is finally possible to program within [CC:T](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-tweaked) ([fabric version](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched)) for all kinds of displays in [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create). ([fabric version](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create))  
In other words, you can display all your  ***f a n c y***  stuff with e.g. Displays *(those flip things)*, Signs, Lecterns or Nixie Tubes via the **Source Block**!  

You can also get informations from blocks via the **Target Block**. For example, you can now get how much stress your network **exactly** has *(in SU)*, a death counter, how many <insert_item_name_here> you produce, etc.  

Or you control Trains by using the **Train Station** as a peripheral or handle much more stuff with the **RedRouter Block**. *(Uses the Redstone API)*  
  
With these blocks, many things you always wanted to handle precicely and easily via lua scripts, are now possible!
