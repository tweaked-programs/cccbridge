About
-----
With this Mod it is finally possible to program within [CC:T](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-tweaked) ([fabric version](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched)) for all kinds of displays in [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create) *(v0.5)*. ([fabric version](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create))  
In other words, you can display all your ***f a n c y*** stuff with e.g. Displays *(those flip things)*, Signs, Lecterns or Nixie Tubes via the **Source Block**!  

You can also get informations from blocks via the **Target Block**. For example, you can now get how much stress your network **exactly** has *(in SU)*, a death counter, how many <insert_item_name_here> you produce, etc.  

Or you controll Trains by using the **Train Station** as a peripheral or handle much more stuff with the **RedRouter**. (Redstone API as its own block)  
  
With these blocks, many things you always wanted to handle precicely and easily via lua scripts, are now possible!

Thats all cool, but how do I use it!?
