<h1 align="center">CC:C Bridge</h1>
<b><p align="center">CC:C Bridge is a MC mod that adds compatibility between the ComputerCraft:R and Create (v0.5) mod!</p></b>

Requires the [Create (v0.5.0c+146](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create) or higher) mod and [CC:Tweaked (v1.100.4](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-tweaked) or higher) mod!  
  
About
-----
With this **forge** mod it is finally possible to program within [CC:T](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-tweaked) for all kinds of displays in [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create) *(v0.5)*.  
In other words, you can display all your ***f a n c y*** stuff with e.g. Displays *(those flip things)*, Signs, Lecterns or Nixie Tubes.
  
*But wait, there's more:*  
Not only can you simulate a **Source Block** *(aka. the part that **sends** data to the Display Link)*, there is also a **Target Block**! This way you can ***get*** data from other sources!  
For example, you can now get how much stress your network **exactly** has *(in SU)*, a death counter, how many <insert_item_name_here> you produce, etc.
  
With these two blocks, many things you can imagine are now possible. To give more examples:  
A fancy flippy monitor *(that you know from the airports)*, that shows a custom schedule plan for your trains! Or an oldschool scoreboard for your mini-games! *(like you may know them from baseball fields.)*

Thats all cool, but how do I use it!?
