# Wrenches and You

Some blocks have the ability to be manipulated via the **Wrench from Create**.  
This mod also implements this feature for the RedRouter Block and Animatronics.

## Right Click
By right clicking on the blocks upwards or downwards facing side, you can **rotate them horizontally**.
The RedRouter Block can be rotated in **90째 steps**, while the Animatronic can be rotated in **45째 steps**.

!!! note
    The Animatronic's rotation can be set to **any number from 0째 to 360째** by manipulating the **block state** using the **Debug Stick** or the `/setblock` command.

## Shift + Right Click

By pressing shift and right clicking, both the **RedRouter Block and the Animatronic can be  removed** and placed **in your inventory instantly**.
